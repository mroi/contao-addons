Contao Addons
=============

I use the [Contao CMS](https://contao.org/) for some websites I maintain. This extension 
adds some extra functionality or customizations of mine.

The individual pieces are:
* Daily mail of Contao log messages. This is especially helpful, when I am the formal
  administrator of a site, but other people can edit some of the content. I just like to
  have an overview of what’s going on.

To use this extension, place a copy of it in Contao’s `system/modules/` directory as a 
subdirectory called `addons`. Since this extension targets my use cases, I did not add 
configurability. You may have to change the code. Also, be aware that most output will be in 
German. Please share if you happen to implement proper localization.
