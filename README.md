Contao Maintenance
==================

I use the [Contao CMS](https://contao.org/) for some websites I maintain. This extension 
performs some recurring work, helping me to keep track of things happening within the CMS.

The individual maintenance tasks are:
* Daily mail of Contao log messages. This is especially helpful, when I am the formal
  administrator of a site, but other people can edit some of the content. I just like to
  see what’s going on.

To use this extension, place a copy of it in Contao’s `system/modules/` directory as a 
subdirectory called `maintenance`. That’s all. Change the code to configure. Also, be aware 
that the mail messages will be in German. Please share if you happen to implement proper 
localization.
