Contao Log Mailer
=================

I use the [Contao CMS](https://contao.org/) for some websites I maintain. In order to keep 
track of things happening within the CMS, I wanted to have log messages mailed to me daily. 
This is especially helpful, when I am the formal administrator of a site, but other people 
can edit some of the content. I just like to see what’s going on.

To use it, place a copy of this in Contao’s `system/modules` directory. That’s all. Change 
the code to configure. Also, be aware that the mail messages will be in German. Please share 
if you happen to implement proper localization.
